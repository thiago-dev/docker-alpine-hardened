# Alpine Hardened Image for Raspberry Pi

A hardened alpine linux image based on [microversecloud/docker-alpine-hardened](https://github.com/microversecloud/docker-alpine-hardened) 

Inspired by: 
- https://github.com/gliderlabs/docker-alpine/issues/101
- https://github.com/gliderlabs/docker-alpine/issues/56

This image serves as a reference example. In practice, you will probably want to harden your own image after you've built everything, rather than rely on a hardened base image.
